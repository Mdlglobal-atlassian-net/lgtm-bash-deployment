# LGTM deployment using shell scripts

This repository contains two worked examples for deploying an LGTM
installation automatically: one for a simple single-machine
configuration, and the other for a more complex multi-machine cluster.

Please see the `README.md` files in the corresponding subdirectory for
more instructions on how best to use and adapt these scripts to your
own environment.
